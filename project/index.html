			<p>"Selin was one of our very first student members at the Institute of Directors. She was dedicated to enhancing the student membership experience at the University of Exeter and helped to found one of the very first student steering committees. The purpose of the committee was to encourage engagement and put on a series of events for fellow student members.</p>
			<p>Selin entered our very first IoD Student Member of the Year Award, which was a new addition to the IoD's Director of the Year Awards this year. I am delighted to say that Selin deservedly won the award. The judges commented 'Selin impressed with her creativity, confidence and ability to work on her own initiative as well as contributing to team activities. She demonstrated that she has good analytical skills, generates ideas, and produces innovative solutions. She is committed to further study and gaining experience to help develop her potential and, with her spirit of enterprise, should have a successful future in business.'" Rebecca Sharpe, IoD</p>
